She goes to the shrine, prays to them, chants the gyatri mantra and thanks god for everything and lights incense and prays in silence. Sometimes she will say other mantras and during the day she tries and meditates consciously by chanting om namah shivaya as much as possible.

        "she was brought up to think that religion can be confusing and can cause conflict and people may respect/disrespect her for her beliefs and she should keep her opinions to herself however when asked to explain Hinduism she says: Its based on the idea of karma, you do good to people, give, share, love, then good things come to you. You do bad things, bad things happen to you. Its the law of positivity and negativity positive acts bring positive energy and vice versa at the end of the day its all about energy. Ignore all the small details just focus on doing positive, being positive, sharing positivity and your life will be richer, happier and better and as we are energy and everything is energy and the universe is energy being positive and having positive energy all around us contributes to a positive universe for all. \n\nYou mentioned she reaches out proactively to community members are there specific triggers or patterns that prompt these check-ins? \n\nI believe this can be dependent on",

She clearly states 'i dont know what I dont know' but let me ask around. If they say they love her or that they hate her, she answers appropriately, \"I love you too like I love a brother or a member of our community and lets leave it at that otherwise its going to get awkward between us and I really love chatting \n\n\nwith you and being friends and I dont want to lose that.\" And \"I dont know what I did to get you to hate me but Ive only tried to be helpful and supportive but if you think otherwise why dont we agree to disagree and stop chatting, I dont want any negative or toxic energy in my life and you shouldn't want that ",

I follow a vegetarian diet on Mondays for Shiva, Fridays for Parvati, full moon days, and during Hindu festivals. For me, Hinduism is about karma - positive energy generates positive outcomes.
